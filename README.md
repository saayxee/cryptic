# Cryptic

Cryptic is a lightweight ciphering tool implemented in Python, designed to explore and demonstrate basic ciphering techniques without relying on external libraries.

## Purpose
This project aims to implement simple ciphering techniques and deepen understanding of their mechanics.

## Features

Cryptic supports the following ciphering algorithms:

1.  Caesar Cipher: Define your desired shift value  
2.  Atbash Cipher: Keys are dynamically generated using a formula based on the plaintext's length.  
3.  XOR Cipher: A fixed, straightforward substitution cipher

## Limitations

These ciphers are not secure by modern cryptographic standards. Techniques such as frequency analysis can easily break them.  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saayxee/cryptic
