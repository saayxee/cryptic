# üîê Cryptic
> [!IMPORTANT]
> These ciphers are not secure by modern cryptographic standards. Techniques such as frequency analysis can easily break them.  

Cryptic is a lightweight ciphering tool implemented in Python, designed to explore and demonstrate basic ciphering techniques.

## Purpose
This project aims to implement simple ciphering techniques and deepen understanding of their mechanics without relying on external libraries.

## Features

Cryptic supports the following ciphering algorithms:

-  Caesar Cipher: Define your desired shift value.
-  Atbash Cipher: Keys are dynamically generated using a formula based on the plaintext's length.  
-  XOR Cipher: A fixed, straightforward substitution cipher.


## Setup
> [!NOTE]  
> Kindly ensure you have Python 3, pip and git installed on your machine.

**Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saayxee/cryptic
```

**Change directory**

```bash
cd cryptic
```


## Usage
**Run the file**
```bash
python keylogger.py
```
**Enter your text**

Input the text you want to cipher.

**Choose a mode**

Choose the ciphering algorithm to wish to implement.
