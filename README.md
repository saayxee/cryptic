# Cryptic
This is a ciphering tool implemented in Python without using any external libraries.

## Features
- Use any of the following three algorithms to cipher text:

  - Caeser Cipher
  - Atbash Cipher
  - XOR Cipher.

- Define Keys/Shift Values (For 2 algorithms, XOR cipher is dynamically generated using a formula based on the length of the plaintext string).

## Limitations
None of these ciphers are considered "secure" as they can be exploited by various techniques such as frequency analysis. My only goal for this project was to implement some simple ciphering techniques, and understand the nature of them. 

## Getting Started
Clone the directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/saayxee/cryptic
```
Then change the directory.
```
cd cryptic
```

Now you may run the `main` script:

```
python main.py
```
NOTE: Make sure you have Python 3 installed
